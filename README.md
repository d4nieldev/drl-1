# Assignment 1 – From Q-learning to Deep Q-learning (DQN)

In this assignment we will get to know and experiment with OpenAI Gymnasium, a testbed for reinforcement learning algorithms containing environments in different difficulty levels. We will first implement a tabular Q-learning model on a simple environment.  Then, we will move on to a larger scale environment and use a NN function approximator of the Q-value, using the basic DQN algorithm. Finally, we will try to improve DQN with one of the state-of the-art algorithms from recent years or implement our own idea for improving DQN.
